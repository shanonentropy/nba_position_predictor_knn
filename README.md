# nba_position_predictor_knn
using KNN to predict player position; exercise building and evaluating KNN models

Tasks:

use pandas and seaborn to explore data, restrict the number of columns by excluding columns that are collinear
using a subset of columns use pipeline and gridsearchcv/randomizedsearchcv to tune hyperparameters of the KNN model

using optimized KNN model, determine the training and testing accuracy of the model; evaluate metrics such as recall, f1-score and confusion matrix

is the model performing better than baseline (largest category)?
